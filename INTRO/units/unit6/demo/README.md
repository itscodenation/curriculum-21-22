# Demo for Unit 6

The demo takes a student project and explains how to improve design through 3 updates
of the students project versioned through git commits.

## Description

The demo was used in a live class lesson to teach version control as well as introduce
design principles to students. V3 being the most advanced design upgrades, that stage
was used to demonstrate how modern front end applications use data to scale their
applications rather then hardcoding the application state. The instructor used the
V3 state in popcode to add cards with student input in real time. Students were able
to see the project scale to a much larger "Choose Your Own Adventure" application in
a matter of minutes.

The original project used to scale the application and improve design was one of the
student projects who performed high in reviews. This way students already had a familiar
grasp of the concepts utilized in the application.

The original project is taken from a student's popcode project here:

must be executed in popcode and because it is missing some libraries and configuration that
popcode manages automatically such as importing jquery and a stylesheet.
